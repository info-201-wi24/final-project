Picture a world where escalating carbon dioxide levels flirt with the atmosphere, pushing climate change to the forefront, disrupting weather patterns, and leaving vulnerable communities in its wake."),

Clicking on the map reveals how severely each county was affected by wildfires (measured by the area of forest burned) and local income before and after the fires. According to statistics, about 22% of fires have caused a loss of local income. Although this figure sounds low, it still proves that wildfires have a negative impact on income. California is the state with the highest economy in the United States, which relies on many high-tech industries during the week. Although only 22% of wildfires caused a loss of revenue, in the remaining cases, the losses caused by wildfires may be masked by high local incomes. This cannot be directly reflected. In other words, because local income is very high, which far exceeds the losses caused by wildfires, it seems from the data that local income is still increasing, but the increase is reduced compared to the case without wildfires. This is a drawback of data, but it is still an issue that cannot be ignored."),

The chart shows that California's population increases with the severity of wildfires (measured by the area of forest burned). The data shows there is no correlation between California's population and the severity of wildfires. But this is not normal, and we believe the following factors are largely responsible for the changes in California's population. For example, California has better educational resources, more job opportunities, higher incomes, and immigration from both foreign countries and within the United States. These are all important factors that could lead to changes in California's population, and the severity of wildfires pales in comparison."),
              h4("Finally, we summarized the area of forest destroyed by wildfires each year. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of forest destroyed by wildfires remained stable. The area of forest destroyed by wildfires increased dramatically in 2017 and 2018. This is due to factors such as climate change and long-term drought. By 2019, the situation of wildfires has improved, and the area of destroyed forest has been reduced to the lowest level in the figure. This shows that people are aware of the seriousness of wildfires and are making positive changes.")
